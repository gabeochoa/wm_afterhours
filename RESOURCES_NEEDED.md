# Resources Needed

Icons and assets that would be useful for expanding the UI showcase but aren't currently available.

## Priority: High

These are commonly needed for game UIs and would significantly expand what screens we can build:

| Icon | Use Case | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Energy/Lightning Bolt** | Stamina systems, power-ups, special abilities | Common in mobile/casual games |
| **Quest/Scroll** | Quest logs, mission briefings | RPG and adventure games |
| **Chat Bubble/Speech** | Dialogue, messaging UI | Social features, story games |
| **Notification Bell** | Alerts, notifications | Very common in modern UIs |
| **XP/Level Star Badge** | Experience points, leveling | RPG progression systems |
| **Map Pin/Marker** | Waypoints, objectives on minimaps | Any game with navigation |
| **Treasure Chest** | Loot, rewards, gacha | Reward systems |
| **Enemy/Skull variants** | Different enemy types, danger levels | Action games |
| **Shield with health cross** | Armor + healing combined | Survival games |
| **Gem varieties** | Ruby, sapphire, emerald for currencies | Premium/multiple currencies |

## Priority: Medium

Would be nice for specific screen types:

| Icon | Use Case | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Compass Rose** | Navigation, direction | Exploration games |
| **Minimap markers** | Player, enemy, ally, objective dots | Tactical games |
| **Weapon silhouettes** | Rifle, pistol, shotgun outlines | Shooter loadout screens |

| **Achievement frames** | Bronze, silver, gold, platinum borders | Achievement systems |
| **Rank emblems** | Military or game ranks | Progression displays |
| **Daily reward calendar** | Calendar with checkmarks | Daily login systems |

## Priority: Low

Edge cases, but would enable specific screen types:

| Icon | Use Case | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Sports equipment** | Ball, goal, whistle | Sports game UIs |
| **Musical notes/instruments** | Rhythm game elements | Music games |
| **Card backs/patterns** | Card game aesthetics | Card battle games |
