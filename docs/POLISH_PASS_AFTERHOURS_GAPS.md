# afterhours gaps found during the 2026-08-29 UI polish pass

Ground rule for this pass: **do not change afterhours**, because Gabe is not
around to review library commits. Everything here is either worked around in
wm or left alone. This file is the review queue for later.

Format: what the library does, why it is wrong, and what wm did instead.

## Open

### `tree_view` indentation does nothing

`tree_view.h:67-79` computes `indent_px = depth * indent_width` and applies it
as `Padding::Left(pixels(indent_px))` on the row button. It has no effect on
where the label draws.

Measured on `file_tree` with a three-deep sample tree: every directory row, at
any depth, put its first ink at x=172, and every file row at x=190. That 18px
is the `"v "` / `"  "` arrow prefix, not padding. All depth information was
lost, so a nested tree rendered as a flat two-level list.

Probable cause: the label is drawn from the row rect using `text_inset` rather
than from the padded content box, so container padding never moves it. Worth
checking whether `Padding::Left` moves a label on any `button`, since that
would be the general version of this bug.

**Workaround in wm:** `FileTreeShowcase` spells the depth into the label as
leading spaces, computed from the path. Because `tree_view` builds the row as
`arrow + label`, the arrows stay in a left gutter and only the names indent.

**Wanted:** row padding that actually offsets the label, so callers do not have
to encode layout in their strings.

### `toggle_switch` computes its label width by hand

`imm_components.h`, `toggle_switch`. The label is sized
`parent_width - track_w`, with a comment saying this dodges "expand()
resolution issues inside absolutely-positioned containers".

Two problems. The workaround itself forgot horizontal padding, so the track
rendered exactly `padding.left + padding.right` past the right edge (fixed in
`70cd11c`, before this ground rule was set). And the reason it exists at all is
that `expand()` does not resolve inside an absolutely-positioned parent, which
is the real bug. Any composite that lays out by hand will hit it again.

**Wanted:** `expand()` that resolves against an absolutely-positioned parent's
resolved size.

### Focus rings draw inside the element, and only two edges

`UIComponent::focus_rect()` insets by its offset, so the ring lands inside the
widget rather than around it, which reads as "too small". Measured on
`self_align`: only the left edge (20px of 48) and the bottom (156px of 184)
render, colour (193,195,196), and only on the 1px falling outside the button.
No top or right edge at all.

Draw order does not explain it (background `rendering.h:1521`, ring `:1613`),
so the cause is still unknown.

**Wanted:** a ring that draws outside the widget bounds on all four edges.

### `text_input` inherits the current screen's theme

Persistent chrome drawn over themed content changes colour per screen. The
navigator sidebar's filter box rendered green on `simple_button`.

**Workaround in wm:** pin explicit colours on the filter box.

**Wanted:** a way to opt a subtree out of the ambient theme.

### Swapping screens from a click handler is a use-after-free

`load_screen` frees the system that `ScreenCyclerSystem` is still iterating.

**Workaround in wm:** record the target index in the handler and drain it after
`systems.run` returns.

**Wanted:** a deferred-teardown path, so a widget callback can safely ask for a
screen change.

### `gen_first_enforce` returns `values[0]` on an empty vector

`entity_query.h:485-491` logs an error for the empty case and then indexes
anyway.

**Wanted:** return the optional/throw rather than reading element 0.

### Headless renders too few frames for time-based animation

Capture runs ~2 frames at dt=0.016, so any easing that starts at zero is caught
mid-transition and can never settle.

**Workaround in wm:** seed animated state at its resting value and put motion
behind interaction.

**Wanted:** either a "settle" pass before capture, or a documented way to ask
an animation for its final value.
