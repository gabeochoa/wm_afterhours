# Afterhours Library Gaps & Workarounds

wm_afterhours vendors afterhours (git submodule) **and** maintains it, so gaps
found during UI work get fixed upstream, merged, and pulled in via a submodule
pin bump — not worked around in wm source. This file tracks only what's still
**open**; resolved gaps are listed compactly for the record (full detail lives in
git history and the afterhours PRs).

## Known limitations (open, low priority)

- **tab order is allocation order, not tree order** — `process_tabbing` moves
  focus by setting it to `ROOT` and letting the next entity the iteration
  reaches grab it, so Tab follows the entity collection's storage order rather
  than the widget tree. Two widgets side by side tab in whatever order they
  were allocated, which is build order today and need not stay that way; there
  is no tab index and no way for a caller to state the order it wants.
  Order-preserving `cleanup()` (`58e1613`) stops widget retirement from
  reshuffling it, which **hides this rather than fixing it** — the order is
  stable now, but it is still the wrong order to be deriving from. A real fix
  sorts focusables by tree position, with an explicit override.

- **a virtualized list still builds a real div for the rows above the fold** —
  `virtual_list` folds the rows *below* the window straight into
  `content_size` via `HasScrollView::unbuilt_content_size`, but the rows above
  it are a `vlist_skipped_above` div of the right height. It cannot be folded
  the same way because the scroll offset is applied when drawing rather than
  when laying out: with nothing in front of it the first built row lays out at
  the top of the content and is then drawn off screen. Folding it needs
  children offset during the layout pass. One div, so the cost is negligible;
  it is the asymmetry that will confuse the next reader.

- **`virtual_list` requires a uniform row height** — finding the window and
  the height of the skipped rows is `offset / row_height`, which is why it is
  cheap. Variable heights need a prefix sum over every item to answer either
  question, which is O(n) per frame and gives back exactly what the
  virtualization was for. Doing it properly means a cumulative-height table
  cached on the component and invalidated when an item resizes. Until then a
  list of mixed-height rows has to pick a single pitch or not virtualize.

- **slider handle 0.75 compression** — the knob's center never quite reaches the
  value position at 100% (cosmetic). `imm_components.h` `slider`. Revisit the
  handle width/position model only if it becomes visible.
- **crowded tab bars still need a smaller font at the call site** — `tab_container`
  content-fit (`expand()` + `min_width = Dim::Text`) removes truncation only when
  the labels *can* fit. A bar with many long labels (e.g. `flight_options`' 9 tabs
  at the default font) still overflows; set a smaller font on the tab_container
  config for those.
- **word-wrap has no hard character break** — with `TextOverflow::Wrap`, a single
  word wider than its box goes on its own line (not split), and wrap requires an
  explicit font size (auto-fit + wrap is ambiguous).

Batch/headless screenshot determinism is a wm-side tooling concern, not an
afterhours gap — tracked in `docs/LAYOUT_AUDIT.md`.

## Resolved & upstreamed (merged into afterhours main, pinned `e348efb`)

- tab_container tab strip bounds under `with_absolute_position`
- **render-command sort recycled-id tiebreak** (SEVERE — fixed 76/79 screens;
  root cause behind the modals breakage, first-child-missing-control, and
  cross-rebuild screenshot non-determinism)
- progress_bar fill/label percent compounding, and track percent compounding
- slider handle position on percent-sized tracks
- stepper multi-visible label separation
- tab_container equal-width → long-label ellipsize (now `expand()` + `Dim::Text`
  min width; added `Dim::Text` to `resolve_constraint`)
- static-label word-wrap — new `TextOverflow::Wrap` feature
- `children()` sizing now includes `flex_gap`
- checkbox/toggle focus ring — confirmed **handled**, not a bug (checkbox/toggle
  are focus clusters via `FocusClusterRoot`/`InFocusCluster`; the ring render is
  type-agnostic with an explicit cluster branch)
- toggle_switch "sibling entities consume layout space" — **not a bug** (internal
  entities are children, not siblings)

Regression tests for these live in the afterhours `tests/` suite: `autolayout_test`,
`progress_bar_test`, `slider_test`, `stepper_test`, `tab_container_test`,
`text_wrap_test`, `render_order_test`.
