overall
- i think we need to make sure we are only rendering the current visible screen otherwise the tabbing will let you tab onto a hidden ui component 
- 

on screen=neon_strike
- buttons in the header are too small, i cant read them
- the save loadout button and back button should be the same size and centering as deploy
- the dmg acc, rof bars are escaping their container 
- focus ring on the dropdown is not correct 


on screen=layout
- the text is too small on some ui elements 
- the right panel is escaping the backgrdoun 
- the stacked items are not centered in their container 
- the "using sage natural..." row is escaping the container
- "lauout system" is escaping the container
