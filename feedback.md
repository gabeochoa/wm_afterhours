overall
- i think we need to make sure we are only rendering the current visible screen otherwise the tabbing will let you tab onto a hidden ui component 
- 

on screen=neon_strike
- lets make the icons better 
- also some next is too small / thin to see at that size 


on screen=layout
- the text is too small on some ui elements 
- the right panel is escaping the backgrdoun 
- the stacked items are not centered in their container 
- the "using sage natural..." row is escaping the container
- "lauout system" is escaping the container

on screen=sports-settings
- each setting should be selectable as a single option, the setting field itsslef shouldnt be a button cause what does the button do? 
- also when you tab it should probably just select the entire row, and each row should be a slider that you can use arrow keys to change the values 
- the hover state makes the font unreadable 
- arrows dont seem to work 

on screen=powerwash_settings
- the non selected setting text is not legible
- each setting should be selectable as a single option, the setting field itsslef shouldnt be a button cause what does the button do? 
- each setting value should be a dropdown that i can actually click on and change 
- the tab buttons should work to change the setting views 

on screen=parcel_corps_settings
- the volume setting should be a slider
- the settings are going off screen 
- the font sizes for each of the text should probably be the same cause right now it feels strange that they all are different sizes and kspacing 
- lets make it so you can change the msaa and teture quality setting avlues
